# Bus-Management-System-in-C
This project manages all bus-related information. It has an admin interface and student/passenger interface. Note that in some places I have used point in place of bus, but essentially they mean the same thing.


These are the functions included in the project:
1. Login
2. Setting a new password for login
3. Installing a new bus
4. Displaying existing buses
5. Deleting a bus
6. Reserving a seat
7. Cancelling reservation
8. Exiting system
